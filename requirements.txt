Task Description: Real-Time Collaborative Whiteboard

Create a real-time collaborative whiteboard application using React and WebSocket technology. The application should allow multiple users to draw, write, and collaborate on a shared canvas in real time.

Key Features:

Canvas Drawing:

Implement a canvas where users can draw using a mouse or touch input.
Include tools for freehand drawing with different colors, line thickness, and an eraser.
Real-Time Collaboration:

Use WebSockets or a similar technology to synchronize changes made by different users in real time.
Ensure that when one user draws something on the canvas, it's immediately visible to all other connected users.
User Authentication:

Implement a basic user authentication system (signup, login) to uniquely identify users.
Each user's drawings should be identifiable by their username or avatar.
Chat Feature:

Include a chat panel alongside the canvas where users can communicate in real time.
Messages should display usernames and timestamps.
Canvas Management:

Provide options to clear the canvas, undo/redo drawings, and export the canvas as an image.
Responsive Design:

Ensure the application works seamlessly on different devices and screen sizes.
Additional Considerations (Optional):

Implement a feature to save and load previously created whiteboards.
Include different drawing tools like shapes, text input, or image insertion.
Enable the ability to share the whiteboard link for others to join the session.
Submission Guidelines:

Upload the code to a GitHub repository with a detailed README explaining how to run the application locally.
Include any necessary setup instructions or dependencies.
Bonus points for deploying the application to a hosting service (like Heroku, Netlify, or Firebase) for live demonstration.
